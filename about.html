      <h2>Mardi Gras</h2>
      <p class="aboutP">
        long since come and gone, and Mardi Gras 2017 is still MONTHS away –but
        that doesn’t mean the spirit of Mardi Gras can’t be found around town
        throughout the year. Guests visiting this summer, you may not be able to
        experience the big, beautiful floats rolling down St. Charles, but you
        can learn about the history behind Mardi Gras and get a
        behind-the-scenes look at what goes into making the floats. Your first
        stop: Mardi Gras World. That’s right, there’s a whole world dedicated to
        Mardi Gras right here in New Orleans! Here you’ll enter the breathtaking
        world where the themed floats are housed all year long. The tour will
        take you through rooms where the floats are being designed and built
        from the ground up. Plus, you’ll get to try on elaborate Mardi Gras
        costumes and enjoy an authentic piece of New Orleans King Cake, which is
        incredibly hard to find out of season! Tours are available from 9:30am
        until 5:30pm seven days a week. From there, head to the Louisiana State
        Museum: Carnival where you’ll learn all about Mardi Gras broken down
        into five easy themes: History, Parades, Balls, Courir du Mardi Gras,
        and Masking. It’s a lot to take in, but believe us, it’s interesting and
        entertaining. It’s a great way to take a break from the heat (or shelter
        from a summer shower!) By now, we know you’ve worked up an appetite – so
        we’ve saved the tastiest for last: Antoine’s. We’re sure you’ve heard of
        this famous and fancy delight, but did you know it houses rooms filled
        with Mardi Gras history? The Rex Room is one of royalty. Named for the
        Krewe of Rex, it’s decorated in green and gold and is home to photos and
        other heirlooms of Rex Royalty. Now, go get your Mardi Gras history on,
        and while you’re at it practice shouting “Throw me something, Mr!”

        <strong>
          As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our
          city to experience the excitement of Mardi Gras!</strong
        >
        Mayor of New Orleans The Carnival season officially begins each year on
        Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called Twelfth Night or Kings’
        Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big
        event. Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling
        before Mardi Gras Day. Our private Carnival clubs, called krewes, take
        on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers.
        Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!" The
        culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day
        when the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade
        through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
        fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages. New Orleans, with
        its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting
        place to be at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience
        Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your plans now to be a
        part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les
        bon temps rouler!" Sincerely, LaToya Cantrell Mayor of New Orleans
