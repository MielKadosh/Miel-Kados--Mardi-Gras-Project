              <strong>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday,</strong> and Easter. It
              belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses that
              offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi
              Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors
              to sell their products or services to those who do not know
              better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government
              for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for
              all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
              organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is
              not true in New Orleans.

              <strong>The Carnival season always begins on Jan.</strong>
              6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
              (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year. Fat
              Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the
              same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash
              Wednesday. Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday
              prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out
              our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next
              few years.

              >
              The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they
              happen in and around their inner-city neighborhoods. Some sources
              say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of
              LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after
              the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of
              Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade. The New Orleans
              Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the
              third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities
              begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle
              Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their
              feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."
              For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.
              Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold
              their "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's
              Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years,
              there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that
              falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter
              Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on these
              events at this time.
